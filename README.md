# xamplify-v2-frontned

This project runs on [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) **version 20.1.4** (uses the Vite-based builder for faster dev builds and HMR).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload (HMR) when you change any source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use:
`ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum`

> Note: Angular 20 defaults to **standalone components**; NgModules are optional.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute unit tests via your configured runner (e.g., Karma or Jest), depending on your `package.json` and `angular.json` setup.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, first add a package that implements e2e capabilities (e.g., Cypress or Playwright).
